Act as a market research analyst for a poker-focused AI startup. I am building a product called PokerPy — your personal AI poker coach, powered by the Harmony Engine. It analyzes your hand histories, finds your leaks, and explains your decisions in plain English — all in seconds. No charts. No jargon. Just sharp, actionable feedback you can use immediately.
Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced grinder, PokerPy adapts to your playstyle using agent-based intelligence:
Upload any hand history (.txt, .json, or pasted logs)
Harmony Engine dissects your decisions: calculates EV, equity, and optimal lines
Learns how the user plays
Explains your mistakes like a coach would — not like a spreadsheet
Visual reports track your leaks over time
Trains your weakest spots with AI-generated study plans
Interactive Insight Agent that is conversational and a poker-genius mentor
It’s like having a GTO solver, a coach, and a performance analyst — all in one clean, simple dashboard.
