PokerPy LLM Integration Debug Report
Problem 1: Fallback Simulation Response (No LLM Output)
Symptom: The backend always returned the fallback simulation output ("This is a test simulation output."), even when SIMULATION_ENGINE=llm and the OpenAI call should have been triggered.
Root Cause: The code checked if engine_mode == "LLM": (case-sensitive), but the environment variable was set as "llm".
Solution: Changed the check to if engine_mode.lower() == "llm": to ensure case-insensitive matching.
Problem 2: OpenAI API Call Fails with Deprecated Syntax
Symptom: After fixing the engine mode, the logs showed an error:
openai.lib._old_api.APIRemovedInV1: You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0
Root Cause: The code used the old OpenAI SDK syntax (openai.ChatCompletion.create), which is not supported in openai>=1.0.0.
Solution: Updated the code to use the v1+ syntax:
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(...)

Problem 3: TypeError: Client.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
Symptom: The OpenAI client failed with:
TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
Root Cause: Proxy-related environment variables (e.g., HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY) were being injected into the container, causing the OpenAI SDK to receive an unsupported proxies argument.
Solution:
Cleared all proxy-related environment variables in the Dockerfile:
ENV HTTP_PROXY= \
    HTTPS_PROXY= \
    http_proxy= \
    https_proxy= \
    ALL_PROXY= \
    all_proxy=

Also passed these as empty values at runtime with -e flags.
Problem 4: OpenAI Client Fails Due to Missing API Key
Symptom: The minimal test script failed with:
The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
Root Cause: The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable was not set in the running container.
Solution: Passed the API key at runtime using -e OPENAI_API_KEY=... in the Docker run command.
Problem 5: OpenAI SDK Version Mismatch
Symptom: Even after upgrading, the container still used an older version of the OpenAI SDK (1.30.5), causing persistent errors.
Root Cause: The requirements.txt file pinned openai to 1.30.5, and Docker builds were not using the latest version.
Solution: Updated requirements.txt to openai>=1.97.0, rebuilt the Docker image, and restarted the container.
Problem 6: Verifying the Fixes
Symptom: Needed to confirm that the OpenAI client could be instantiated and that the backend could make successful LLM calls.
Solution:
Created and ran a minimal test script in the container to verify OpenAI client instantiation.
Triggered simulation requests and checked logs for LLM output.
Confirmed that the backend now returns dynamically generated LLM scenarios.
Final State
The backend now successfully calls the OpenAI API and returns LLM-generated poker simulation scenarios.
All proxy, API key, and SDK version issues have been resolved.
The system is fully operational for LLM-powered poker simulation.
